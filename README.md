	Our project will simulate buying stocks and viewing stock fluctuations with imaginary money to provide educational value and experience without risking loss of real money, while also being able to view stock information related to recent political events. This can benefit individuals who are trying to learn about the industry from the college business student to people with personal political stakes. We will be utilizing React to dynamically load information from the Yahoo Finance API based on the user’s stock portfolio, Firebase to store information of the user’s stock portfolio, and a CSS library such as Bootstrap and Chart.js to give our site a more responsive, user-friendly style. With these technologies, we will be able to develop a web application that will match our goals of providing an intuitive method of learning about trading stocks.
